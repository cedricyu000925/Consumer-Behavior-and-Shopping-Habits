# Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits
**Project Overview**

This project analyzes consumer shopping behavior to help a retail company optimize its sales strategies, loyalty programs, and personalized recommendations. As a data analyst working for the customer insights and marketing team, I explored key factors influencing customer behavior to uncover actionable business insights.

The analysis leverages a dataset containing customer demographics, purchasing patterns, shipping preferences, payment methods, and promotional usage. This project aims to provide data-driven recommendations to improve marketing strategies, enhance customer retention, and increase revenue.

**Tools Used**

Python: For data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Jupyter Notebook: For organizing and executing the analysis.
